## Dataset Overview

- MovieLens 100k Dataset
- Data Source: Kaggle

### MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.

### This data set consists of:
- 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
- Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
- Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
- The data was collected through the MovieLens web site (movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
- Jupyter notebook or any other python software installed on your local machine.
- The 'ml-100k' dataset available.
  
## Installation
- Create a new Jupyter Notebook.
- Import the dataset into the Jupyter file using provided Python scripts.

## Part-1 : Data Cleaning
- Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
- Clean and format the timestamp data.
- Handlinng outliers in the dataset.
- Check for duplicate entries in the dataset.

## Part-2 : Data Visualization
-  Distribution of movie ratings.
-  Most popular movies (top 10 or 20) among users.
-  Visualize the distribution of rentals by day of the week or time of day.
 
## Part-3 : Data Summerization
- Calculatinng the descriptive statistics.
- Summarize the number of unique users and movies in the dataset.
- Find the most active users (top 10 or 20) based on the number of movie rentals.
